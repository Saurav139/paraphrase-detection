# Paraphrase Detection with Siamese Neural Networks  and BERT

Paraphrase detection involves determining how similar two sentences or pieces of text are, often indicating whether they convey the same information. This similarity can be measured using various approaches, primarily by comparing the distance between their vector representations. A smaller squared distance indicates greater similarity, and this principle is the foundation for paraphrase detection.

## Siamese Neural Networks

Siamese Neural Networks are particularly well-suited for tasks involving similarity or distance measurement, such as paraphrase detection, face recognition, and recommendation systems. They use two identical branches to process pairs of inputs and learn a similarity metric using **contrastive loss** or **triplet loss**.

- **Anchor, Positive, Negative**: During training, three data points are used: Anchor, Positive, and Negative. The network minimizes the squared distance between Anchor and Positive while maximizing the distance between Anchor and Negative.
- **Network Training**: Siamese networks are trained on pairs or triplets of inputs, with similarity labels guiding the network to embed similar inputs closer together in the learned feature space.

## Network Architecture

- Each branch processes one text input and encodes it into a fixed-length vector representation.
- Techniques like **RNNs** or **CNNs** are used to encode the text.
- The branches share the same weights and architecture, ensuring consistent feature extraction.

The Siamese architecture effectively identifies semantic similarities between texts, making it ideal for paraphrase detection tasks.
